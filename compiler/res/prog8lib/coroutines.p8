; Cooperative multitasking / Coroutines
; EXPERIMENTAL LIBRARY: Api may change or it may be removed completely in a future version!

; Achieves cooperative multitasking among a list of tasks each calling yield() to pass control to the next.
; Uses cpu stack return address juggling to cycle between different tasks.
;
; Features:
; - can have a dynamic number of active tasks (max 64), when a task ends it is automatically removed from the task list.
; - you can add new tasks, while the rest is already running.  Just not yet from inside IRQ handlers!
; - tasks are regular subroutines but have to call yield() to pass control to the next task (round-robin)
; - yield() returns the registered userdata value for that task, so a single subroutine could be used as multiple tasks on different userdata
;   BUT!! in that case, the subroutine cannot have any variables of its own that keep state, because they're shared across the multiple tasks!
;   (if a subroutine is just inserted as a task exactly ONCE, it's okay to use normal variables for state, because nobody will share them)
; - you can kill a task (if you know it's id...)
; - when all tasks are finished the run() call will also return.
; - tasks can't push anything on the cpu stack before calling yield() - that will cause chaos.
; - this library is not (yet) usable from IRQ handlers. Don't do it. It will end badly.  (can't manipulate the task list simultaneously)
;
; Difference from IRQ handlers:
; - you can have many tasks instead of only 2 (main program + irq handler)
; - it's not tied to any IRQ setup, and will run as fast as the tasks themselves allow
; - tasks fully control the switch to the next task; there is no preemptive switching
; - tasks will need to save/restore their own state, maybe by useing the userdata (pointer?) and/or task id for that.
;
; USAGE:
; - call add(taskaddress) to add a new task.  It returns the task id.
; - call run(supervisor) to start executing all tasks until none are left. Pass 0 or a pointer to a 'supervisor' routine.
;   that routine can for instance call current() (or just look at the active_task variable) to get the id of the next task to execute.
;   It has then to return a boolean: true=next task is to be executed, false=skip the task this time.
; - in tasks: call yield() to pass control to the next task. Use the returned userdata value to do different things.
;   For now, you MUST call yield() only from the actual subroutine that has been registered as a task!
;   (this is because otherwise the cpu call stack gets messed up and an RTS in task1 could suddenly pop a return address belonging to another tasks' call frame)
; - call current() to get the current task id.
; - call kill(taskid) to kill a task by id.
; - call killall() to kill all tasks.
; - IMPORTANT:  if you add the same subroutine multiple times, IT CANNOT DEPEND ON ANY LOCAL VARIABLES OR R0-R15 TO KEEP STATE. NOT EVEN REPEAT LOOP COUNTERS.
;   Those are all shared in the different tasks! You HAVE to use a mechanism around the userdata value (pointer?) to keep separate state elsewhere!
; - IMPORTANT:  ``defer`` cannot be used inside a coroutine that is reused for multiple tasks!!!
